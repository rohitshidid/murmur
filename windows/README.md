# Murmur for Windows

The Windows port of Murmur — push-to-talk dictation, on-device.

> **Status: in progress.** The dictionary engine is complete and passes the shared
> behavioural contract. The audio, hotkey, injection and UI layers are specified in detail
> but not yet written. **None of this has ever run on Windows** — see [Honesty](#honesty).

## Why this is a rewrite, not a port

Almost every layer of the macOS app is Apple-specific:

| Layer | macOS | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| UI | SwiftUI | Avalonia |
| Audio capture | `AVAudioEngine` | WASAPI via NAudio |
| **Default speech engine** | `SpeechAnalyzer` (ships with macOS 26) | **nothing equivalent exists** |
| Parakeet | FluidAudio → CoreML | sherpa-onnx → ONNX Runtime |
| Hotkey | `CGEventTap` | `SetWindowsHookEx(WH_KEYBOARD_LL)` |
| Text injection | Accessibility API | `SendInput` |

The consequence that shapes everything: **Windows has no counterpart to Apple's
`SpeechAnalyzer`.** On macOS, Parakeet is the optional upgrade. On Windows it is the only
engine, and the app cannot transcribe until the model is downloaded —
see [`docs/PARAKEET-WINDOWS.md`](../docs/PARAKEET-WINDOWS.md).

What *is* genuinely shared is the dictionary's behaviour, and it is shared as a contract
rather than as code: [`shared/dictionary-test-vectors.json`](../shared/dictionary-test-vectors.json).
Both implementations run those vectors in CI. Changing correction semantics starts there.

There is now a **second contract** in the same shape:
[`shared/formatting-test-vectors.json`](../shared/formatting-test-vectors.json), specifying the
text structure pass — spoken retraction (including the alignment that repairs a value in
place rather than erasing the sentence around it), spoken commands, list inference, email
greetings and sign-offs, caret continuation, and the guard around the optional grammar-repair
model pass. The macOS side implements it in `Sources/MurmurFormatting`, which is deliberately
platform-neutral: pure Foundation, no AppKit, no Speech. **The C# port does not exist yet**
— the vectors are there so that when it is written there is something to write it against,
the same way the dictionary was.

The regex subset constraint applies to it identically, and for the same reason.

## Decisions, and why

**Avalonia, not WPF or WinUI 3.** WPF cannot be run or UI-tested on macOS, so every mistake
would cost a full CI round-trip. Avalonia's headless test platform runs on macOS in ~100 ms,
including simulated keyboard input and real pixel capture. Win32 interop is unaffected —
hooks, `SendInput` and WASAPI are P/Invoke, not UI-framework code. WinUI 3 was rejected
outright: Microsoft's own docs contradict each other on whether unpackaged single-file
publishing works, with open bugs reporting an exe that won't launch.

**.NET 10, not .NET 8.** .NET 8 reaches end-of-life on **2026-11-10**.

**Right Ctrl is the default hotkey, not Right Alt.** Right Alt is AltGr on German, Polish,
UK, Nordic and most Latin-American layouts — it is how those users type `@`, `€`, `\`, `|`.
Binding push-to-talk there would break basic typing for a large fraction of users. Right
Ctrl produces no character on any layout.

**The hotkey is observed, never swallowed.** The macOS build consumes Right Option because
on macOS that key types characters. On Windows, suppression buys nothing and risks a much
worse failure: if the key-down is swallowed but the key-up escapes — a hook that timed out
mid-gesture, or focus crossing into an elevated window — the target app believes Ctrl is
held down forever.

**CPU-only inference.** sherpa-onnx ships no GPU package; DirectML is five versions behind
and forbids the variable tensor shapes this model requires; CUDA would force every user to
install a toolkit. On CPU with int8 weights, transcription runs ~40× faster than real time.

**Three pinned versions that would break at "latest":**

| Package | Pinned | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `NAudio` | **2.3.0** | 3.x targets .NET 9+ and will not restore |
| `Avalonia.Headless.XUnit` | **11.3.20** | 12.x requires xUnit **v3**, a different package line |
| `org.k2fsa.sherpa.onnx` | 1.13.5 | Bundles ONNX Runtime; never also reference `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime` |

## Layout

```
windows/
├─ Directory.Build.props        strict analysis, applied to every project
├─ Directory.Packages.props     central version pinning
├─ global.json                  SDK pin
├─ src/
│  └─ Murmur.Dictionary/        net10.0 — platform-neutral, so CA1416 makes any
│                               Windows-only API call a build error
└─ tests/
   └─ Murmur.Dictionary.Tests/  runs the shared vectors
```

Planned, following the same rule — platform-neutral unless it truly cannot be:

```
   Murmur.Abstractions/      IAudioCapture, IHotkeySource, ITextInjector  (net10.0)
   Murmur.Speech/            sherpa-onnx behind ITranscriber              (net10.0)
   Murmur.Platform.Windows/  the ONLY Win32 code in the repo              (net10.0-windows)
   Murmur.App/               Avalonia UI                                  (net10.0-windows)
```

Keeping the platform layer logic-free is deliberate: anything that lives there is code CI
cannot exercise. Retries, debouncing, device-change handling all belong in the neutral
projects, behind an interface.

## Building

```bash
cd windows
dotnet restore Murmur.sln
dotnet build   Murmur.sln --no-incremental -warnaserror
dotnet test    Murmur.sln
```

`--no-incremental` is not optional. Roslyn does not re-emit analyzer warnings on an
incremental build, so `-warnaserror` would pass on cached results and prove nothing.

## <a id="honesty"></a>Honesty about what is verified

**Verified:** the dictionary logic passes all 19 shared vectors in Swift on this machine.
The C# implementation is a line-by-line counterpart with the same regex construction,
including `RegexOptions.CultureInvariant` and NFC normalization.

**Not verified:** that the C# code compiles. That is what the CI workflow is for, and its
first green run is the first real evidence.

**Known divergences between the two regex engines**, measured across 30 cases — 9 differed.
The two that affect this code are both handled: culture-sensitive case-insensitive matching
(fixed by `CultureInvariant`) and NFC/NFD mismatch (fixed by normalizing both sides). Two
that are *not* fixable are simply avoided: ICU folds `ß` to `ss` and .NET does not, and
.NET's `.` splits surrogate pairs. Neither is reachable from the patterns this code builds.

**Cannot be verified in CI at all:** text injection into a foreground application. GitHub
runners have an interactive desktop, but foreground activation fails there. That needs a
real Windows machine.
